"""Allow VLLM_PLE_CPU_OFFLOAD on multi-node deployments.

Upstream's ``_validate_ple_offload_config`` blanket-rejects ``nnodes != 1``,
but the offload process is spawned per WorkerProc (``spawn_ple_offload()`` in
``multiproc_executor``) — every rank gets its own node-local table process,
and the pidfd tensor handover never crosses a host boundary. The check is
conservatism, not architecture. This patch downgrades it to a warning.

Applied at image build:  python3 patch_ple_offload_multinode.py <gpu_worker.py>
Guarded: refuses loudly if the exact check is not found.
